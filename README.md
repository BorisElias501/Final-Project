My Photo Agency
Hello The website on which my project is based represents a photography agency. It has five sections in which we develop the different parts of the project such as: 
1- The navigation bar, the start menu and the landing page (this section has a link to another page that describes different articles on the art of photography) 
2- A section that represents a gallery. (has a link to another alternative photo gallery) 3- A section that represents the services provided by the photographic 
agency (this section has a link to another page that describes the services provided) 4- A section that represents the work team of the photographic agency
(does not have links) 5- A contact section that represents a form to contact the work team. 6- finally, the footer appears in which relevant information is 
represented. This website appears developed on the css bootstrap framework, in which js code is used to validate the form, give alerts to change pages and 
animate the images of the alternative gallery, also the use of the media query (media queries) is used briefly in the css file corresponding to the landing 
page of the main page. Lastly, the site uses Lorem Ipsum simulated text to develop the content. This work is only a first approach to the art of web design 
and development by a novice.
